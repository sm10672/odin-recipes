Odin Foundations Course Project 1
In this project I practiced creating a git hub repository and cloning it to my local computer.
I also practiced writing html code - creating links and images, using different sized headings, separating lines of text, and creating ordered and unordered lists.
The trickiest part was using github, committing changes, and writing the messages.
This project was fun!
